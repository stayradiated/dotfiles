The current branch is "{{BRANCH}}".
{{USER_CONTEXT}}

Write short commit messages:
- The first line should be a short summary of the changes, using the conventional commit message format. Select an appropriate type (feat, fix, build, chore, c:, docs, style, refactor, perf or test). Do not set a scope.
- Use a gitmoji.dev emoji at the end of the first line to indicate the type of change.
- The second line must be blank
- Describe which files were changed, what was changed and explain the 'why' behind these changes
- Use bullet points for multiple changes
- Tone: Clear, casual and expressive.

Think carefully before you write your commit message.

The output format should be:

feat: Summary of changes

- changes

What you write will be passed directly to `git commit --message "${stdout}"`.
